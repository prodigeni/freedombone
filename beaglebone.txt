* Introduction

#+BEGIN_VERSE
/If you look at it from an engineering perspective, an iterative perspective, it’s clear that you have to try something rather than do nothing./

-- Edward J. Snowden
#+END_VERSE

** What is FreedomBone?
Today many of us rely upon "free" services in the cloud, such as Gmail, Facebook, Google+ and so on.  It might appear that these services are indispensible infrastructure of the modern internet, but actually they're not strictly needed and the amount of value which they deliver to the average internet user is very marginal.  It is possible to be a citizen of the internet and yet not use those things - to disintermediate the most well known companies and cut out their prurient or merely cringeworthy business models.

FreedomBone is a personal home communications server based upon the BeagleBone Black hardware.  It's small and cheap and will allow you to use email, have your own web site and do social networking in a federated way without needing to rely upon any intermediary companies other than your ISP.
** Do I need any prior knowledge?
In these instructions only a minimal level of familiarity with Linux is assumed.  It's assumed that you know the basics of the /nano/ and /emacs/ editors, but it would be simple to also use other editors if you prefer.
** Why should I do this?
You should consider doing this if you are a freedom-oriented sort of person and you want to maintain sovereignty over your information.  Laws in many places in the world consider you to have relinquished any property rights over data which you put onto a server not owned by youself (i.e. owned by a third party, such as Google or Facebook).

If you don't like the idea of having all your communications intercepted and investigated by the Surveillance State then you should consider running a FreedomBone.  If your profession involves maintaining confidentiality as an essential feature, such as legal or medical services, counselling, teaching or any sort of activism then you should consider running a FreedomBone.

As Eben Moglen noted in his now famous [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOEMv0S8AcA]["Freedom in The Cloud"]] talk the simple fact of you keeping your own internet logs (found in the /var/log directory) puts a certain amount of power in your hands and takes it away from parties who would otherwise sell that information without your knowledge or permission to advertisers or other shady outfits who may not have your best interests at heart.
** After it's installed will it need a lot of maintenance?
So long as the hardware is ok the amount of maintenance needed should be very small.  Unlike on Windows based systems you don't need to defragment drives or mess about with anti-virus programs.  I ran a similar Sheevaplug system between 2010 and 2013 with only occasional software updates or reboots, and uptime was probably 99% or better.
** Is it secure?
Nothing is totally secure or infallible.  You could have the most secure technology and yet still use easy to guess passwords.  This system will not defend you from an attacker who is actively trying to block or corrupt your communications, but I assume that doesn't apply in the majority of cases.  Another thing to be aware of is that running a FreedomBone could make you more vulnerable to traffic analysis, since the server is associated with your home address and isn't a giant aggregation of users somewhere in the cloud.  You need to weigh this alongside the additional legal protection which owning the server and having it in your own home gives you.

FreedomBone should be far more secure than using popular cloud-based services which have spying built into them as a core feature (although not one which is typically advertised), but it is not necessarily an impenetrable information fortress.
** Will running a server all the time affect my electricity bill?
Hardly at all.  The BeagleBone Black consumes very little power - less than 5W.  It would even be potentially possible to run it from a solar panel.
* Inventory

These instructions assume that you have the following ingredients.

** A BeagleBone Black (BBB)

It should come with a suitable USB cable for the initial setup.  To make things look nicer you may also want to get a case for it.

** An internet connection

It is assumed that the most common situation is via a router installed at home. The router should have ethernet sockets on it and a web interface which allows you to forward ports (sometimes under the "firewall" settings), so that you can forward ssh and web traffic to the BBB.

** microSD card

To use as the main storage for the BBB.  16 or 32GB is fine, and can be obtained quite cheaply.  Try to use Sandisk (class 10 or better) where possible and avoid cheaper cards which often have poor performance.

You may also need an SD card adaptor or USB card reader in order to flash the operating image to the microSD card.  For instance, many laptops have an SD card slot but not a microSD slot.

** 5V/1A power supply

With a plug suitable for powering the BBB.  If you have some device with a USB socket nearby you may also be able to just use that for electrical power.  However, powering from the USB cable alone might result in crashes when the system is under load, depending upon how many milliamps can be supplied by the USB hub/socket.  If the system crashes due to running out of power then you will see that the LEDs on the BBB are continuously on, rather than flashing.

** An ethernet patch cable

Just an ordinary cat5 or cat6 cable that you can get from most electrical/computer stores.

* Installing Debian onto the microSD card

The Debian Linux OS will be installed onto a small flash drive.  It's a good idea to do this rather than using the internal flash, because it will allow you to easily create backups of the entire system if necessary using the dd command.

Download the image.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
wget http://freedombone.uk.to/debian-7.2-console-armhf-2013-11-15.tar.xz
#+END_SRC

Verify it.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
md5sum debian-7.2-console-armhf-2013-11-15.tar.xz
0a448f55d14f64c5a7eb3d7cb2c54185  debian-7.2-console-armhf-2013-11-15.tar.xz
#+END_SRC

Uncompress it.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
tar xJf debian-7.2-console-armhf-2013-11-15.tar.xz
cd debian-7.2-console-armhf-2013-11-15
#+END_SRC

Create the disk image, where sdX is the name of the flash drive (probably it will be sdb or sdc).

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
sudo apt-get install u-boot-tools
sudo ./setup_sdcard.sh --mmc /dev/sdX --uboot bone --swap-file 1024
#+END_SRC

Once completed then safely remove the microSD card via your file manager (usually right click and "safely remove" or "eject").

* Setup

#+BEGIN_VERSE
/Build the tools for a future you would want to live in/

-- Kurt Opsahl
#+END_VERSE

** Things to be aware of
*** A note on ssh
When using ssh to log into the BBB if you get warnings of the type "/the ECDSA host key for domain differs from the key for the IP address/" then run the command:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
ssh-keygen -R <IP address>
#+END_SRC
*** Passwords
It's highly recommended that you use a password manager, such as KeepassX, and make all your passwords long random strings.  It's also a good idea to use different passwords for different pieces of software, instead of one or two passwords for the whole system.  That compartmentalises the security such that even if an attacker gains access to one system they can't necessarily get access to others.
** Initial
Plug the microSD card into the BBB and Connect the USB cable to your laptop/desktop, then login via ssh.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
ssh debian@192.168.7.2
#+END_SRC

The default password is /temppwd/

Then log in as root:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
su
#+END_SRC

The default password is /root/

The first thing to do is to change the passwords from their defaults.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
passwd
#+END_SRC

Then you will need to change the network interfaces.  The main task here is to comment out the stuff related to usb0.  That will enable you to plug the BBB into the back of a router and for it to be detectable on the network.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
nano /etc/network/interfaces
#+END_SRC

The resulting interfaces file should look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.60
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.1.254
    dns-nameservers 213.73.91.35 85.214.20.141
# Example to keep MAC address between reboots
#hwaddress ether DA:AD:CE:EF:CA:FE

# WiFi Example
#auto wlan0
#iface wlan0 inet dhcp
#    wpa-ssid "essid"
#    wpa-psk  "password"

# Ethernet/RNDIS gadget (g_ether)
# ... or on host side, usbnet and random hwaddr
# Note on some boards, usb0 is automaticly setup with an init script
# in that case, to completely disable remove file [run_boot-scripts] from the boot partition
#iface usb0 inet static
#    address 192.168.7.2
#    netmask 255.255.255.0
#    network 192.168.7.0
#    gateway 192.168.7.1
#+END_SRC

CTRL-O followed by ENTER to save, then CTRL-X to exit.

In the above example "address 192.168.1.60" is a static IP address for the BBB, which will allow incoming network traffic to be directed from the router in a reliable manner.  It should be outside of the DHCP range set up on the router.

"gateway 192.168.1.254" should be the IP address of the router.

Note that setting the DNS servers with dns-nameservers is important because some home routers do not allow you to change the DNS settings.

Edit resolv.conf.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
nano /etc/resolv.conf
#+END_SRC

It should look something like the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
domain localdomain
search localdomain
nameserver 213.73.91.35
nameserver 85.214.20.141
#+END_SRC

CTRL-O followed by ENTER to save, then CTRL-X to exit.

Now disconnect the BBB from your computer and plug it into the router.  You'll need an ethernet patch cable and you may also need a 5V/1A power supply for the BBB.

If you go to the web administration screen for your internet router (often it's on 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.1.254) then after a few minutes you should see the BBB appear on the network.  It's name will be "arm".

** Add a user

Ssh back in to the BBB and login as root.  In this example the BBB's IP address is 192.168.1.60.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
ssh-keygen -f "/home/myusername/.ssh/known_hosts" -R 192.168.1.60
ssh debian@192.168.1.60
su
#+END_SRC

Then make a new user.  It's a bad idea to add users to the sudo group, because that then means that an attacker potentially only needs to know one password in order to get administrator access to the system.  With no sudoers an attacker needs to know, or be able to obtain, two separate passwords to be able to really compromise the system.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
adduser myusername
#+END_SRC

Exit from the ssh login by typing "exit" a couple of times, then ssh back in as the new user.  Make sure you use a difficult to guess password/phrase, or ideally a randomly generated password used together with a password manager such as KeepassX.

Remove the default debian user.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
userdel -r debian
#+END_SRC

** Text editor

For an editor which is less erratic than vi when used within a remote console such as Terminator.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
apt-get update
apt-get install emacs
#+END_SRC

** Alter ssh configuration

Altering the ssh configuration will make it a little more secure than the standard Debian settings.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#+END_SRC

Check the following values:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
PermitRootLogin no
X11Forwarding no
ServerKeyBits 4096
Protocol 2
PermitEmptyPasswords no
StrictModes yes
#+END_SRC

Append the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
Ciphers aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr
MACs hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-ripemd160
KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1
#+END_SRC

CTRL-X CTRL-S to save, then CTRL-X CTRL-C to exit.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
service ssh restart
#+END_SRC

To test the new settings log out by typing "exit" a couple of times, then log back in again with:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
ssh -vvv myusername@192.168.1.60
#+END_SRC

and check that some number of bits are set within a 4096 bit sized key:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
debug2: bits set: */4096
#+END_SRC

** Set the host name

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
emacs /etc/hostname
#+END_SRC

CTRL-X CTRL-S to save, then CTRL-X CTRL-C to exit.

also issue the command

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
hostname /myhostname/
#+END_SRC

You may also need to assign the same hostname separately via your router's web interface.

** Install NTP

To synchronise time.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
apt-get install ntp
#+END_SRC

** Install fail2ban

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
apt-get install fail2ban
#+END_SRC

** Getting onto the web
Create a subdomain on [[http://freedns.afraid.org][freeDNS]].  You may need to click on "/subdomains/" a couple of times.  FreeDNS is preferred because it is one of the few domain name providers which supports genuinely free (as in beer) accounts.  So if your budget is tiny or non-existent you can still participate as a first class citizen of the internet.  If you do have money to spend there is also a premium option.

Select "/dynamic DNS/" then click "/quick cron example/"

An example would look like:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
4,9,14,19,24,29,34,39,44,49,54,59 * * * * root sleep 29 ; wget -O - http://free\ dns.afraid.org/dynamic/update.php?ABCKDNRCLFHENSLKNFEGSBFLFF== >> /\ tmp/freedns_mysubdomain_us_to.log 2>&1 &
#+END_SRC

Edit /etc/crontab and append that to the end of the file.

Via your router's firewall settings you should now open port 22 (secure shell).  This will allow you to ssh into your BBB from any location - not just your own local network.

** install Email

#+BEGIN_VERSE
/If you knew what I know about email, you might not use it/

-- Ladar Levison
#+END_VERSE

Email is not very secure, but its usefulness and ubiquity mean that it's likely to continue as a primary communications method for many years to come.  You can encrypt the contents of email using PGP/GPG, but very few people do that and even for those that do the metadata (the From/To/CC/BCC) is always transmitted in the clear as a fundamental aspect of the protocol, allowing an attacker to easily construct detailed models of people's social network and life patterns even without knowing the content.

Exim4 seems much easier to install and configure than Postfix.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
aptitude install exim4 sasl2-bin swaks libnet-ssleay-perl
#+END_SRC

You will be prompted to remove postfix.  Say yes and yes again.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config
#+END_SRC

Settings as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
internet site

System mail name: mydomainname.com

IP addresses to listen on: blank

Destinations: mydomainname.com

Domains to relay mail: blank

Smarthost Relay: 192.168.1.0/60 (the range of addresses on your LAN)

Dial on demand = no

Split configuration = no

Root and postmaster: root email
#+END_SRC

** Mutt email client

echo "text/html; lynx -dump -width=78 -nolist %s | sed ‘s/^ //’; copiousoutput; needsterminal; nametemplate=%s.html" > ~/.mutt/mailcap
#+END_SRC

Save and exit.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash

Append the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
set mbox_type=Maildir
set folder="~/Maildir"
set mask="!^\\.[^.]"
set mbox="~/Maildir"
set record="+.Sent"
set postponed="+.Drafts"

#+END_SRC

Save and exit.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash

#+END_SRC

Uncomment *use_bayes*, *bayes_auto_learn*

Save and exit, then run:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
service spamassassin restart
#+END_SRC

Now to add an address book:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
emacs ~/.muttrc
#+END_SRC

Append the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
set alias_file=~/.mutt-alias
source ~/.mutt-alias
set query_command= "abook --mutt-query '%s'"
macro index,pager A "<pipe-message>abook --add-email-quiet<return>" "add the sender address to abook"
#+END_SRC

Then save and exit.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
touch ~/.mutt-alias
#+END_SRC

Finally you can then type *mutt* to get access to your email.  Hence as a fallback, or if you prefer as the primary way of accessing email, you can ssh into the BBB and use the mutt command line email client.  Ssh clients are available for all operating systems, and also you should be reasonably protected from passive surveillance between wherever you are and the BBB (although not between the BBB and the wider internet), which can be useful if you are for example using an Android tablet from a cafe or railway station.

To use the address book system open an email and then to add the sender to the address list press the A key.  It will ask you for an alias which may be used the next time you want to send a mail.  Alternatively you may just edit the *~/.mutt-alias* file directly to add email addresses.

Some useful keys to know are:

| ESC / | Search for text within message contents                 |
| "/"   | Search for text within headers                          |
| *     | Move to the last message                                |
| TAB   | Move to the next unread message                         |
| d     | Delete a message                                        |
| u     | Undelete a mail which is pending deletion               |
| $     | Delete all messages selected and check for new messages |
| a     | Add to the address book                                 |
| m     | Send a new mail                                         |
| S     | Mark a message as spam                                  |
| H     | Mark a message as ham                                   |

	#   SSL Engine Options:
	#   Set various options for the SSL engine.
	#   o FakeBasicAuth:
	#     Translate the client X.509 into a Basic Authorisation.  This means that
	#     the standard Auth/DBMAuth methods can be used for access control.  The
	#     user name is the `one line' version of the client's X.509 certificate.
	#     Note that no password is obtained from the user. Every entry in the user
	#     file needs this password: `xxj31ZMTZzkVA'.
	#   o ExportCertData:
	#     This exports two additional environment variables: SSL_CLIENT_CERT and
	#     SSL_SERVER_CERT. These contain the PEM-encoded certificates of the
	#     server (always existing) and the client (only existing when client
	#     authentication is used). This can be used to import the certificates
	#     into CGI scripts.
	#   o StdEnvVars:
	#     This exports the standard SSL/TLS related `SSL_*' environment variables.
	#     Per default this exportation is switched off for performance reasons,
	#     because the extraction step is an expensive operation and is usually
	#     useless for serving static content. So one usually enables the
	#     exportation for CGI and SSI requests only.
	#   o StrictRequire:
	#     This denies access when "SSLRequireSSL" or "SSLRequire" applied even
	#     under a "Satisfy any" situation, i.e. when it applies access is denied
	#     and no other module can change it.
	#   o OptRenegotiate:
	#     This enables optimized SSL connection renegotiation handling when SSL
	#     directives are used in per-directory context.

	#   SSL Protocol Adjustments:
	#   The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
	#   approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait for
	#   the close notify alert from client. When you need a different shutdown
	#   approach you can use one of the following variables:
	#   o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
	#     This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
	#     SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates
	#     the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use
	#     this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where
	#     mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.
	#   o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
	#     This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
	#     SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
	#     alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
	#     practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
	#     this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation
	#     works correctly.
	#   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP
	#   keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable
	#   keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
	#   Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround
	#   their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
	#   "force-response-1.0" for this.
	BrowserMatch "MSIE [2-6]" \
		nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
		downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
	# MSIE 7 and newer should be able to use keepalive
	BrowserMatch "MSIE [17-9]" ssl-unclean-shutdown

Then to enable the site:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
a2ensite
a2dissite default
a2dissite default-ssl
a2enmod rewrite
a2enmod headers
#+END_SRC

Ensure that "NameVirtualHost *:443" is added to /etc/apache2/ports.conf.  It should look something like the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
NameVirtualHost *:80
Listen 80

<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
	NameVirtualHost *:443
    Listen 443
</IfModule>

<IfModule mod_gnutls.c>
    NameVirtualHost *:443
    Listen 443
</IfModule>
#+END_SRC

Create a self-signed certificate. The passphrase isn't important and will be removed, so make it easy (such as "password").

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
emacs makecert
#+END_SRC

Enter the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
#!/bin/bash

HOSTNAME=$1

openssl genrsa -des3 -out $HOSTNAME.key 1024
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 3650 -key $HOSTNAME.key -out $HOSTNAME.crt
openssl rsa -in $HOSTNAME.key -out $HOSTNAME.new.key
cp $HOSTNAME.new.key $HOSTNAME.key
rm $HOSTNAME.new.key
cp $HOSTNAME.key /etc/ssl/private
chmod 400 /etc/ssl/private/$HOSTNAME.key
cp $HOSTNAME.crt /etc/ssl/certs
shred -zu $HOSTNAME.key $HOSTNAME.crt
a2enmod ssl
service apache2 restart
#+END_SRC

Save and exit.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
chmod +x makecert
./makecert mydomainname.com
#+END_SRC

Enter some trivial password for the key file.  The password will be removed as part of the makecert script.  Note that leaving a password on the key file would mean that after a power cycle the apache server will not be able to boot properly (it would wait indefinitely for a password to be manually entered) and would look as if it had crashed.

If all has gone well then there should be no warnings or errors after you run the service restart command.  After that you should enable ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) on your internet router/firewall, such that they are redirected to the BBB.

*** Friendica
**** Installation

See [[Setting up a web site]] for details of how to update the Apache configuration for your Friendica site.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
apt-get install mysql-server php5-common php5-cli php5-curl php5-gd php5-mysql php5-mcrypt
#+END_SRC

Enter an admin password for MySQL.

Create a mysql database.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
mysql -u root -p
create database friendica;
CREATE USER 'friendicaadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON friendica.* TO 'friendicaadmin'@'localhost';
quit
#+END_SRC

You may need to fix Git SSL problems.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
git config --global http.sslVerify true
apt-get install ca-certificates
cd ~/
emacs .gitconfig
#+END_SRC

The .gitconfig file should look something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
[http]
        sslVerify = true
        sslCAinfo = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
[user]
        email = myusername@mydomainname.com
        name = yourname
#+END_SRC

Get the source code.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
export HOSTNAME=mydomainname.com
cd /var/www/$HOSTNAME
mv htdocs htdocs_old
git clone https://github.com/friendica/friendica.git htdocs
chmod -R 755 htdocs
chown -R www-data:www-data htdocs
chown -R www-data:www-data htdocs/view/smarty3
git clone https://github.com/friendica/friendica-addons.git htdocs/addon
#+END_SRC

Now visit the URL of your site and you should be taken through the rest of the installation procedure.  If you have trouble with "allow override" ensure that "AllowOverride" is set to "all" in your Apache settings for the site (within /etc/apache2/sites-available) and then restart the apache2 service.

Install the poller.

#+BEGIN_SRC
emacs /etc/crontab
#+END_SRC

and append the following, changing mydomainname.com to whatever your domain is.

#+BEGIN_SRC
*/10 *  * * *	root	cd /var/www/mydomainname.com/htdocs; /usr/bin/php include/poller.php
#+END_SRC

Save and exit, then restart cron.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
service cron restart
#+END_SRC

You can improve the speed of Friendica database searches by adding the following indexes:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
mysql -u root -p
use friendica;
CREATE INDEX `uri_received` ON item(`uri`, `received`);
CREATE INDEX `received_uri` ON item(`received`, `uri`);
CREATE INDEX `contact-id_created` ON item(`contact-id`, created);
CREATE INDEX `uid_network_received` ON item(`uid`, `network`, `received`);
CREATE INDEX `uid_parent` ON item(`uid`, `parent`);
CREATE INDEX `uid_received` ON item(`uid`, `received`);
CREATE INDEX `uid_network_commented` ON item(`uid`, `network`, `commented`);
CREATE INDEX `uid_title` ON item(uid, `title`);
CREATE INDEX `created_contact-id` ON item(`created`, `contact-id`);
quit
#+END_SRC

**** Backups

Make sure that the database gets backed up.  By using cron if anything goes wrong then you should be able to recover the database either from the previous day or the previous week.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
emacs /etc/cron.daily/friendicabackup
#+END_SRC

Enter the following

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
#!/bin/sh

MYSQL_PASSWORD=<mysql root password>

umask 0077

# Backup the database
mysqldump --password=$MYSQL_PASSWORD friendica > /var/backups/friendica_daily.sql

# Make the backup readable only by root
chmod 600 /var/backups/friendica_daily.sql
#+END_SRC

Save and exit.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
chmod 600 /etc/cron.daily/friendicabackup
chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/friendicabackup
emacs /etc/cron.weekly/friendicabackup
#+END_SRC

Enter the following

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
#!/bin/sh

MYSQL_PASSWORD=<mysql root password>

umask 0077

# Backup the database
mysqldump --password=$MYSQL_PASSWORD friendica > /var/backups/friendica_weekly.sql

# Make the backup readable only by root
chmod 600 /var/backups/friendica_weekly.sql
#+END_SRC

Save and exit.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
chmod 600 /etc/cron.weekly/friendicabackup
chmod +x /etc/cron.weekly/friendicabackup
#+END_SRC

**** Recommended configuration
***** Admin
To get to the admin settings you will need to be logged in with the admin email address which you specified at the beginning of the installation procedure.  Depending upon the theme which you're using "/admin/" will be available either as an icon or on a drop down menu.

Under the *plugins* section the main one which you may wish to enable is the NSFW plugin.  With that enabled if a post contans the #NSFW tag then it will appear minimised by default and you will need to click a button to open it.

Under the *themes* section select a few themes, including mobile themes which are suitable for phones or tablets.

Under the *site* section give your Friendica node a name other than "/my friend network/", you can change the icon and banner text and set the default mobile theme typically to /frost-mobile/.  If you don't want your node to host a lot of accounts for people you don't know then you may want to set the register policy to "/requires approval/".  For security it's probably a good idea only to host accounts for people who you actually know, rather than random strangers.  Also be aware that the Beaglebone does not have a great deal of computational power or bandwidth and will not function well if there are hundreds of users using your node.  If you're not federating with Diaspora or other sites then you may wish to select "/only allow Friendica contacts/".  That improves the security of the system, since communication between Friendica nodes is always encrypted separately and in addition to the usual SSL encryption layer - which makes life interesting for the Surveillance State and at least keeps those cryptanalysts employed.

It's probably a good idea to enable "/private posts by default for new users/" and also "/don't include post content in email notifications/".  Since traditional email isn't a secure system and is easily vulnerable to attack by systems such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore][Xkeyscore]].

***** Settings
Each user has their own customisable settings, typically available either via an icon or by an entry on a drop down menu.

Under *additional features* enable "/richtext editor/", "/post preview/", "/group filter/", "/network filter/", "/edit sent posts/" and "/dislike posts/".

Under *display settings* select your desktop and mobile themes.

Once you have connected to enough friends it's also a good idea to use the "/export personal data/" option from here.  This will save a file to your local system, which you can import into another friendica node if necessary.
**** To access from an Android device
***** App
Open a browser on your device and go to https://f-droid.org/ then download and install the F-Droid apk.  If you then open F-Droid you can search for and install the Friendica app.

If you are using a self-signed certificate then at the login screen scroll down to the bottom, select the SSL settings then scroll down and disable SSL certificate checks.  You will then be able to log in using https, which at least gives you some protection via the encryption.

More information about the Friendica app can be found on http://friendica-for-android.wiki-lab.net/
***** Mobile Theme
Another way to access Friendica from a mobile device is to just use the web browser.  If you have selected a mobile theme within your settings then when viewing from an Android system the mobile theme will be displayed.
*** Red Matrix
**** Introduction
Red Matrix is the current version of the Friendica social networking system.  It's more general than Friendica in that it's designed as a generic communication system based around a protocol called "zot".  At the time of writing in early 2014 Red Matrix remains at an alpha stage of development and so it's not advised that you install it unless you're willing to put up with bugs and frustrations.  In the large majority of cases it's better to stick with Friendica for now.

**** Prerequisites
The main problem with Red Matrix is that in order to install it you will need to have purchased a domain name (i.e. not a FreeDNS subdomain) and a SSL certificate for it.

You could join some other Red Matrix server, but this suffers from "/The Levison Problem/" in which some goons show up with a gagging order demanding coppies of the SSL private key.  In that scenario unless the owner of the server is exceptionally brave users may never be informed that the site has been compromised or that there is interception hardware attached to the server.  Joining another server defeats the object of being digitally self-sufficient and raises legal question marks about the ownership of data which you might upload to a server which doesn't belong to you.

**** Installation

See [[Setting up a web site]] for details of how to update the Apache configuration for your Red Matrix site.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
apt-get install mysql-server php5-common php5-cli php5-curl php5-gd php5-mysql php5-mcrypt
#+END_SRC

Enter an admin password for MySQL.

Create a mysql database.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
mysql -u root -p
create database redmatrix;
CREATE USER 'redmatrixadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON redmatrix.* TO 'redmatrixadmin'@'localhost';
quit
#+END_SRC

You may need to fix Git SSL problems.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
git config --global http.sslVerify true
apt-get install ca-certificates
cd ~/
emacs .gitconfig
#+END_SRC

The .gitconfig file should look something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
[http]
        sslVerify = true
        sslCAinfo = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
[user]
        email = myusername@mydomainname.com
        name = yourname
#+END_SRC

Get the source code.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
export HOSTNAME=mydomainname.com
cd /var/www/$HOSTNAME
mv htdocs htdocs_old
git clone https://github.com/friendica/red.git htdocs
chmod -R 755 htdocs
chown -R www-data:www-data htdocs
mkdir htdocs/view/tpl/smarty3
chmod 777 htdocs/view/tpl
chmod 777 htdocs/view/tpl/smarty3
git clone https://github.com/friendica/red-addons.git htdocs/addon
#+END_SRC

Now visit the URL of your site and you should be taken through the rest of the installation procedure.  Note that this may take a few minutes so don't be concerned if it looks as if it has crashed - just leave it running.  If you have trouble with "allow override" ensure that "AllowOverride" is set to "all" in your Apache settings for the site (within /etc/apache2/sites-available) and then restart the apache2 service.

Install the poller.

#+BEGIN_SRC
emacs /etc/crontab
#+END_SRC

and append the following, changing mydomainname.com to whatever your domain is.

#+BEGIN_SRC
*/10 *  * * *	root	cd /var/www/mydomainname.com/htdocs; /usr/bin/php include/poller.php
#+END_SRC

Save and exit, then restart cron.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
service cron restart
#+END_SRC

**** Backups

Make sure that the database gets backed up.  By using cron if anything goes wrong then you should be able to recover the database either from the previous day or the previous week.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash

**** To access from an Android device
***** App
Open a browser on your device and go to https://f-droid.org/ then download and install the F-Droid apk.  If you then open F-Droid you can search for and install the Friendica app.

If you are using a self-signed certificate then at the login screen scroll down to the bottom, select the SSL settings then scroll down and disable SSL certificate checks.  You will then be able to log in using https, which at least gives you some protection via the encryption.

** Install a Blog

Wordpress is the most popular blogging platform, but in practice I found it to be high maintenance with frequent security updates and breakages.  More practical for a home server is Flatpress.  Flatpress doesn't use a MySql database, just text files, and so is easy to relocate or reinstall.

See the [[Setting up a web site]] section of this document for details of how to configure the web server for your blog's domain.

Download flatpress.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
wget http://freedombone.uk.to/flatpress.tar.gz
#+END_SRC

Verify the download:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
md5sum flatpress.tar.gz
6ad5c230a5cb1ac096ff657f1b138cc7  flatpress.tar.gz
#+END_SRC

Extract and install it.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
tar -xzvf flatpress.tar.gz
cd flatpress-*
cp -r * /var/www/$HOSTNAME/htdocs
rm -rf flatpress-*
rm -f flatpress.tar.gz
#+END_SRC

Now visit your blog and follow the setup instructions, which are quite minimal.  Various themes and addons are available from the Flatpress web site, http://www.flatpress.org

** Install a VoIP server

#+BEGIN_VERSE
/Our core principles, whether in software or sovereignty, have always been about freedom and dignity, for all people, on an equal basis/

-- David Sugar, GNU Telephony
#+END_VERSE

*** The server
Sipwitch is like an introduction service or phone book for SIP VoIP clients.  Once introduced the clients can then talk directly, and this means that sipwitch is very lightweight and can run on low power systems such as the BBB.

Edit your package sources:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
emacs /etc/apt/sources.list
#+END_SRC

Append the following line:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
deb http://dev.gnutelephony.org/archive/ wheezy/
#+END_SRC

Save and exit.

To load the repository the first time after adding it to the sources.list, since you do not have the verification keys already installed yet. Then do

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
apt-get install gnutelephony-keyring
#+END_SRC

After that it will be happy to accept it as a signed repository. The verification keys can also be directly fetched with

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
wget http://dev.gnutelephony.org/archive/wheezy/public.key
#+END_SRC

and manually added instead with

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
apt-key add public.key
#+END_SRC

To make sure you have all dependencies, do

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
apt-get update;apt-get dist-upgrade
#+END_SRC

Before we install anything, let's inspect what is available to us by using

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
dpkg -l sipwitch
#+END_SRC

To see the main application. The columns will indicate if the package is installed, which version and a description of the package. Then do

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
dpkg -l sipwitch-*
#+END_SRC

to see available supporting applications and plugins. Again, the columns will indicate if the package is installed, which version and a description of each of these.

To install only the main application, do

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
apt-get install sipwitch
#+END_SRC

and to install all supporting plugins:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
apt-get install sipwitch-plugin-scripting sipwitch-plugin-subscriber sipwitch-plugin-forward sipwitch-plugin-zeroconf
#+END_SRC

Add your user into the sipwitch group

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
groupadd sipwitch
groupadd sipusers
usermod -aG sipwitch myusername
usermod -aG sipusers myusername
#+END_SRC

Then edit the configuration

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
emacs /etc/sipwitch.conf
#+END_SRC

Change the *mapped* value from 200 to 20, since we don't want to be serving huge numbers of calls.

Alter the *range* value to 10, since we don't need a large number of extensions.  This will mean that exension numbers 200 to 209 are available.

Do not set the *realm* value, as doing so seems to prevent the server from working.

Save and exit.

Create a digest string for your username:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
sipwitch digest myusername
#+END_SRC

Make a note of the resulting string because you're going to use it in the users file you'll now create.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
export HOSTNAME=mydomainname.com
touch /etc/sipwitch.d/$HOSTNAME.xml
chmod 600 /etc/sipwitch.d/$HOSTNAME.xml
emacs /etc/sipwitch.d/$HOSTNAME.xml
#+END_SRC

It should look something like the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
<provision>
    <user id="myusername">
        <digest>yourdigeststring</digest>
		<extension>201</extension>
		<display>Your full name</display>
    </user>
</provision>
#+END_SRC

Save and exit.  Now edit the configuration.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
emacs /etc/default/sipwitch
#+END_SRC

Change "desktop" to "server", then save and exit.

Update the IP settings:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5060 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 5060 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5061 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 5061 -j ACCEPT
iptables-save
#+END_SRC

Test that it's working:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
pkill -9 sipw
sipw -x9 -f
#+END_SRC

Then try to register with the server using a SIP client (such as Jitsi). If everything worked then use CTRL-C to exit.  Then start the service.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
service sipwitch start
#+END_SRC

*** Clients
**** Jitsi
Download the latst version from https://jitsi.org/index.php/Main/Download

TODO
**** Twinkle client

The client should have a user profile as following:

The "user name" is the xxx id used in the <user id="xxx"> entry of /etc/sipwitch.conf

The "domain" is the yyy domain in the main config <stack><domain>yyy entry of /etc/sipwitch.conf

The SIP Authentication should have:

realm = realm as set in <registry><realm> of /etc/sipwitch.conf

authentication name = <user id="xx"> entry, same as "User Name" field.

password = value of <secret>zzz in <user> entry of /etc/sipwitch.conf

Under security tab, set "Enable ZRTP/SRTP encryption"
**** Android

** Install an IRC server
*** Basic install

IRC is not an especially secure system.  For instance, even with the best encryption it's easily possible to imagine IRC-specific cribs which could be used by cryptanalytic systems.  However, we'll try to implement it in a manner which will at least give the surveillance aparatus something to ponder over.

First install some dependencies.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
apt-get update
apt-get install build-essential openssl libssl-dev
#+END_SRC

Then get the source code for ircd-hybrid.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
cd /tmp
mkdir hybrid
cd hybrid
apt-get source ircd-hybrid
#+END_SRC

Modify the source code to include SSL security.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
emacs ircd-hybrid-*/debian/rules
#+END_SRC

Beneath MAXCLIENTS add the line:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
USE_OPENSSL = 1
#+END_SRC

Then save and exit.  Now we can build the debian package for ircd-hybrid and install it.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
cd ircd-hybrid-*
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b
cd ..
dpkg -i ircd-hybrid_*.deb
#+END_SRC

Customise the configuration to your system, giving it a name and description.  In this example 192.168.1.60 is the static IP address on the BBB on the local network, so change that if necessary.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
emacs /etc/ircd-hybrid/ircd.conf
#+END_SRC

Set *name* to the name of your server, and set a description.

Set a *network_name* and *network_desc*.

Set max_clients to 20, or however many you expect that you'll typically need.

Within the admin section set your *name* and *email*.

Within the *listen* section set host to your fixed IP address (in the earlier
sections it was 192.168.1.60).

Within the *auth* section set user = "*@192.168.1.60" - or whatever the fixed IP address of the BBB is on your network.

Save and exit, then restart the IRC server.  Open ports 6666-6670 on your internet router and forward them to the BBB.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
cd /tmp
wget http://freedombone.uk.to/hybserv2.tar.gz
#+END_SRC

Verify it.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
md5sum hybserv2.tar.gz
12efc53c421f4919f11328e48dbc519d  hybserv2.tar.gz
#+END_SRC

Install it.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
tar -xzvf hybserv2.tar.gz
cd hybserv2-*
./install.fast
#+END_SRC

Edit the configuration.

Make a md5 version of the password for the IRC server operator.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
mkpasswd -Hmd5 <operatorpassword>
#+END_SRC

Edit the ircd-hybrid configuration.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
emacs /etc/ircd-hybrid/ircd.conf
#+END_SRC

Enter the md5 password which you previously created within the /operator/ section.  Also change /user/ to:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
	user = "*@*";
#+END_SRC

Then save and exit.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
emacs /usr/local/hybserv/hybserv.conf
#+END_SRC

Change #MD5 PASSWORD HERE# to the md5 operator password created earlier:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
O:*@*:#MD5 PASSWORD HERE#:root:segj (comment out other Q: lines)
A:mynickname <myemailaddress>
N:mydomainname.com:Hybrid services
S:ConnectPassword:192.168.1.60:6667 (remove the other two services)
#+END_SRC

Save and exit.

Create a daemon for hybserv2.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
emacs /etc/init.d/hybserv2
#+END_SRC

Enter the following, replacing /myusername/ with your username.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash

** Install Gopher
Gopher is an old internet protocol which originated a few years before the web and is purely text based.  It can be quite fun to build a gopher site and browse the gopherverse.  One thing to keep in mind is that there is no security with gopher, so any text transmitted is trivially interceptable by systems such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore][Xkeyscore]] or deep packet inspection.

To set up a gopher server:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
apt-get install build-essential
wget http://freedombone.uk.to/geomyidae-current.tgz
#+END_SRC

Verify the download:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
md5sum geomyidae-current.tgz
3d8bb8601f37ca953b00fc2445ab5abe  geomyidae-current.tgz
#+END_SRC

Then extract and install it.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
tar -xzvf geomyidae-current.tgz
cd geomyidae-*
make
make install
mkdir -p /var/gopher
#+END_SRC

Your content should be placed within /var/gopher with the index page being named index.gph.  The Gopher format is very simple - simpler than HTML - so creating pages is not much more difficult than editing a text file.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
emacs /etc/init.d/gopher

On your internet router change the firewall settings to route port 70 to the BBB, then provided that you have a gopher plugin installed within your browser then you should be able to navigate to your gopher site with:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash

#+END_SRC

There is a browser addon for Gopher called "overbite".  Installing that should enable you to view your site.

** Install a Wiki
Dokuwiki is based upon flat files, and so is easy to move from one server to another without a lot of database complications.

Download the wiki.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash

	SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/mydomainname.com.key


	#   SSL Engine Options:
	#   Set various options for the SSL engine.
	#   o FakeBasicAuth:
	#     Translate the client X.509 into a Basic Authorisation.  This means that
	#     the standard Auth/DBMAuth methods can be used for access control.  The
	#     user name is the `one line' version of the client's X.509 certificate.
	#     Note that no password is obtained from the user. Every entry in the user
	#     file needs this password: `xxj31ZMTZzkVA'.
	#   o ExportCertData:
	#     This exports two additional environment variables: SSL_CLIENT_CERT and
	#     SSL_SERVER_CERT. These contain the PEM-encoded certificates of the
	#     server (always existing) and the client (only existing when client
	#     authentication is used). This can be used to import the certificates
	#     into CGI scripts.
	#   o StdEnvVars:
	#     This exports the standard SSL/TLS related `SSL_*' environment variables.
	#     Per default this exportation is switched off for performance reasons,
	#     because the extraction step is an expensive operation and is usually
	#     useless for serving static content. So one usually enables the
	#     exportation for CGI and SSI requests only.
	#   o StrictRequire:
	#     This denies access when "SSLRequireSSL" or "SSLRequire" applied even
	#     under a "Satisfy any" situation, i.e. when it applies access is denied
	#     and no other module can change it.
	#   o OptRenegotiate:
	#     This enables optimized SSL connection renegotiation handling when SSL
	#     directives are used in per-directory context.

	#   SSL Protocol Adjustments:
	#   The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
	#   approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait for
	#   the close notify alert from client. When you need a different shutdown
	#   approach you can use one of the following variables:
	#   o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
	#     This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
	#     SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates
	#     the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use
	#     this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where
	#     mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.
	#   o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
	#     This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
	#     SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
	#     alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
	#     practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
	#     this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation
	#     works correctly.
	#   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP
	#   keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable
	#   keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
	#   Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround
	#   their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
	#   "force-response-1.0" for this.
	BrowserMatch "MSIE [2-6]" \
		nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
		downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
	# MSIE 7 and newer should be able to use keepalive
	BrowserMatch "MSIE [17-9]" ssl-unclean-shutdown

</VirtualHost>
</IfModule>
#+END_SRC

Enable your site with:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
a2ensite
#+END_SRC

then select the domain name and reload.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
service apache2 reload
#+END_SRC

and alter permissions:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
chmod -R 755 /var/www/$HOSTNAME/htdocs
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/$HOSTNAME/htdocs
#+END_SRC

Open a browser and visit http://$HOSTNAME/install.php, then fill out the details.  Once everything has been accepted without errors:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
rm /var/www/$HOSTNAME/htdocs/install.php
#+END_SRC

** Install Owncloud

First create an apache configuration for your Owncloud site.  You will need to create a new subdomain via FreeDNS.  See the earlier section on [[Setting up a web site]] for details.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
emacs /etc/php5/apache2filter/php.ini
#+END_SRC

Set the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
post_max_size = 32M
upload_max_filesize = 32M
#+END_SRC

Restart apache.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
service apache2 restart
#+END_SRC

Install some dependencies:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
apt-get install apache2 php5 php5-gd php-xml-parser php5-intl
apt-get install php5-sqlite php5-mysql smbclient curl libcurl3 php5-curl
#+END_SRC

Download owncloud.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
cd /tmp
wget http://freedombone.uk.to/owncloud.tar.bz2
#+END_SRC

Verify the download:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
md5 owncloud.tar.bz2
f43eabb746b5e339ee70d0a6aaf4a49c
#+END_SRC

Extract the archive.  This may take a couple of minutes, so don't be alarmed that the system has crashed.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
export HOSTNAME=myownclouddomainname.com
tar -xjf owncloud.tar.bz2
#+END_SRC

Move the extracted files to your site.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
cp -r owncloud /var/www/$HOSTNAME
rm -rf /var/www/$HOSTNAME/htdocs
mv /var/www/$HOSTNAME/owncloud /var/www/$HOSTNAME/htdocs
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/$HOSTNAME/htdocs/
chmod 775 /var/www/$HOSTNAME/htdocs
chmod 664 /var/www/$HOSTNAME/htdocs/*
chmod g+s /var/www/$HOSTNAME/htdocs
#+END_SRC

With a web browser visit your domain and enter an administrator username and password.

** Install Tripwire

Tripwire will try to detect any intrusions into your system. It's a good idea to install it after you have installed all of the other programs which you intend to use.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
apt-get install tripwire
export HOSTNAME=mydomainname.com
cd /etc/tripwire
cp arm-local.key $HOSTNAME-local.key
cp site.key $HOSTNAME-site.key
tripwire --init
tripwire --update-policy --secure-mode low /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt
tripwire --check --interactive
#+END_SRC

you will be asked for two passphrases ("site" and "local").  Make a note of these.

If you subsequently install any more packages or make configuration changes then update the policy again with:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
tripwire --update-policy --secure-mode low /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt
#+END_SRC

Also, to look for any rootkits.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
apt-get install rkhunter
#+END_SRC

* Router/Firewall ports
The following ports on your internet router/firewall should be forwarded to the BBB.

| Protocol |     Port/s |
|----------+------------|
| Gopher   |         70 |
| HTTP     |         80 |
| HTTPS    |        443 |
| IMAP     |        143 |
| IRC      | 6665..6669 |
| IRC SSL  |       6670 |
| SIP      | 5060..5061 |
| SMTP     |         25 |
| SMTPS    |        465 |
| SSH      |         22 |

* Hints and Tips
** Messaging security
If you're connected to other friends via Friendica then the preferred way to send private messages is via Friendica's built-in messaging system.  This is a lot more convenient than using GPG with ordinary email and yet still provides a similar level of protection from unwarranted interception.
** Restrictive/hostile user environments
If you are typically operating within a restrictive of hostile environment where using ssh is not an option because everything other than web ports are blocked then you may wish to try installing oterm:

http://www.coralbits.com/oterm/

https://github.com/davidmoreno/onion
** Moving Domains
If you're moving servers and using a different domain name or path then you can search and replace URLs within files in the following way:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
find /var/www/mynewdomain/htdocs -type f -exec sed -i 's@myolddomain@mynewdomain@g' {} \;
#+END_SRC

** MySql foo
*** Backup all databases
To back up all mysql databases:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases --events > /var/backups/databasebackup.sql
#+END_SRC
*** Restoring a particular mysql database
To restore yesterday's friendica backup:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
mysql -D friendica -o < /var/backups/friendica_daily.sql
#+END_SRC

To restore yesterday's mediawiki backup:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
mysql -D wikidb -o < /var/backups/wikidb_daily.sql
#+END_SRC
*** Removing mysql server

If you manage to screw up sql server completely then it can be fully deleted with:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
ps aux | grep mysql
#+END_SRC

and use /kill -9 <pid>/ to kill all mysql processes.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
apt-get remove --purge mysql\*
apt-get clean
updatedb
#+END_SRC
